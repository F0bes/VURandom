# VURandom, test your VPUs randomness

(Originally created to test PCSX2's VPU random generator)

VCL code is in randomgen.vcl

A non-register version is in randomgen.namedvars.vcl

Change your random seed in the vcl code

The EE code (VURandom.c) is commented

All three (DobieStation,Play!,PCSX2) emulators have accurate implementations!
